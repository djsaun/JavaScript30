    // start with strings, numbers and booleans
    // let age = 100;
    // let age2 = age;
    // console.log(age, age2);
    // age = 200;
    // console.log(age, age2);

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players;

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    // team[3] = 'Lux';

    // however what happens when we update that array?
    // It updates the reference array as well. So players now has the "Lux" item in the 3rd index spot

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way
    const team2 = players.slice();

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players);

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players];
    const team5 = Array.from(players);

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object
    const person = {
      name: 'David',
      age: 28
    }

    // with Objects

    // and think we make a copy:
    const captain = person;
    //captain.number = 99; applies to the reference object as well

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, { number: 99, age: 13 }); // start with blank obj, pass in obj you wish to copy properties from, fold in new properties you wish to overwrite

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.

    const wes = {
      name: 'Wes',
      age: 100,
      social: {
        twitter: '@twitter',
        facebook: 'facebook'
      }
    }
    // cloneDeep workaround
    const dev = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(wes));
